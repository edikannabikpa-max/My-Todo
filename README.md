## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd todo-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build the application for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally

## Technology Choices and Reasoning

### Why React 19+?
- Modern hooks API for cleaner component logic
- Built-in Suspense for better loading states
- Excellent performance and developer experience
- Large ecosystem and community support

### Why React Router?
- Industry-standard routing solution for React
- Declarative routing with nested routes
- Built-in support for navigation and URL parameters
- Excellent documentation and community support

### Why Axios?
- Promise-based HTTP client with better error handling
- Request and response interceptors for centralized logic
- Automatic JSON transformation
- Better browser compatibility than fetch

### Why Tailwind CSS?
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Consistent design system out of the box
- Excellent mobile-first responsive design
- Small production bundle size with purging
- Easy to maintain and customize

### Why Vite?
- Extremely fast development server with HMR
- Optimized production builds
- Modern tooling with ESM support
- Better developer experience than Create React App

## Key Features Explained

### Pagination System
The application implements a robust pagination system that:
- Fetches 10 todos per page from the API
- Displays page numbers and Previous/Next controls
- Scrolls to the top when changing pages
- Shows current page state visually

### Search and Filter
Users can:
- Search todos by title with real-time updates
- Filter by completion status (All/Completed/Incomplete)
- Combine search and filter for precise results
- See helpful messages when no results are found

### Error Handling
The application has multiple layers of error handling:
1. **Error Boundary**: Catches React component errors
2. **API Error Handling**: Handles network and API errors gracefully
3. **404 Page**: Custom page for undefined routes
4. **Loading States**: Shows spinners during data fetching

### Accessibility
The application follows WCAG AA standards:
- Semantic HTML for better screen reader support
- ARIA attributes for enhanced accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Focus management and visible focus indicators

## API Integration Details

### Custom Hook Pattern
The application uses custom hooks (`useTodos`, `useTodoById`) that:
- Encapsulate data fetching logic
- Manage loading and error states
- Provide automatic refetching capabilities
- Follow React best practices

### API Error Handling
All API calls include:
- Try-catch error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry functionality
- Loading state management

## Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with:
- Mobile-first design approach
- Tailwind's responsive utilities (sm, md, lg breakpoints)
- Flexible grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly interface elements

## Browser Support

- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. CRUD operations (Create, Update, Delete) are implemented in the API utility but not yet connected to the UI
2. No authentication system (marked as advanced feature)
3. No real-time updates via WebSocket (marked as advanced feature)

### Planned Enhancements
1. **CRUD Operations**: Add forms for creating, editing, and deleting todos
2. **Authentication**: Implement user login/signup flows
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Connect to WebSocket for live updates
4. **User Profile**: Add user profile management
5. **Protected Routes**: Implement route guards for authenticated users
6. **Improved Filtering**: Add more filter options (date, priority, tags)
7. **Drag and Drop**: Allow reordering of todos
8. **Dark Mode**: Add theme switching capability
9. **Offline Support**: Implement service workers for offline functionality
10. **Unit Tests**: Add comprehensive test coverage

## Performance Optimizations

- **Code Splitting**: Routes are lazy-loaded with Suspense
- **Memoization**: `useMemo` for expensive computed values
- **Optimized Re-renders**: Proper component structuring to minimize re-renders
- **Tailwind Purging**: Unused CSS is removed in production builds

## Deployment

### Recommended Platform
- **Netlify**: Zero-config deployment with continuous deployment

### Deployment Steps

1. Build the production version:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. The `dist` folder contains the production-ready files

3. Deploy to your chosen platform following their documentation

### Environment Variables
No environment variables are required for the current implementation as the API URL is hardcoded. For production, consider using:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.oluwasetemi.dev
```

## Submission Guidelines

### Repository Setup ✅
- ✅ Private GitHub repository created
- ✅ Clear commit messages throughout development
- ✅ Proper `.gitignore` file included
- ✅ Ready to add @Oluwasetemi as collaborator

### Deployment
- Application is deployed to netlify: https://69908f1087f5c9934f1efc90--edy-todo.netlify.app
- All features work in production environment
